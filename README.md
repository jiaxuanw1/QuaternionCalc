# QuaternionCalc

A Java program for performing basic operations with quaternions as well as finding the conjugate, norm, and inverse of a quaternion.

Quaternions are a four-dimensional number system that extends the complex numbers. 
They can be used to describe rotation in three dimensions. Learn more about complex numbers [here](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Quaternion.html).

## Usage

The app allows you to input one or two quaternions. Underneath them, you can select a mathematical operation (i.e. addition, subtraction, etc.).

To calculate the conjugate, norm, and inverse of a quaternion, input the quaternion as q1 and click Calculate.

To add or subtract two quaternions, input the two quaternions, select "Add"/"Subtract", and click Calculate.

To multiply two quaternions (A * B), input quaternion A as q1 and quaternion B as q2, select "Multiply," and click Calculate.

To divide two quaternions (A / B), input quaternion A as q1 and quaternion B as q2, select "Divide," and click Calculate.
